    <!--How Do Block and Inline Quotes Work in HTML?-->
    <!--
        In HTML, quoted elements are used to distinguish quoted text from the surrounding content. 
        This gives the quoted text a format that is easy to identify.
        You should use the block quotation element for representing a section quoted from another source. 
        It's mainly used for extended quotations. 
        If the source of the quote has an address, you can cite it with the cite attribute.
        (the attribute doesn't really show the source to the user. It only works behind the scenes.) 
        The value of this attribute should be a valid URL.
        If you want to start and end the block quote with quotation marks, 
        you may need to write them explicitly within the text.  
    -->
    <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
        "Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? 
        To have built software systems that people rely upon?"
    </blockquote>

    <!--
        You can write the text directly within the block quotation element 
        or wrap it within one or more paragraph elements. 
        This is helpful when the text has multiple paragraphs, 
        but you want to keep them within the same block quote.    
    -->
    <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
        <p>Build your projects. Show them to your friends. Build projects for your friends.</p>
        <p>Build your network. Help the people you meet along the way. What goes around comes around. You'll get what's coming to you.</p>   
        <p>It is not too late. Life is long.</p>
        <p>You will look back on this moment years from now and be glad you made a move.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <!--
        If you want to attribute the source visually, you can add a citation element, 
        cite, outside of the block quotation element. 
        This is different from the cite attribute. 
        The citation element is an HTML element that you can use to mark up the title 
        of a referenced creative work like a book article, song, film, website, or research paper.
    -->
    <div>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
            Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? To have built software systems that people rely upon?

    <!--
        The block quotation element contains quoted text. 
        Below the element you can see a paragraph element with the name of the author, 
        followed by a citation element. 
        The citation element contains the title of the book where the quotation came from.
    -->


    <!--
        You should use block quotes like these for long quotations from other sources. 
        But sometimes you will only need to quote a few words within a larger paragraph.
        That's exactly what the inline quotation element is for. 
        It's for short inline quotations from other sources. 
        Most modern browsers will add quotation marks around the inline quote automatically 
        when you use this element.
        You can also add a cite attribute to attribute the source.

    <!--How Do You Display Abbreviations in HTML?-->

    <!--
        There are two common forms of abbreviations: acronyms and initialisms.

        An acronym is a word formed from the initial letters of a phrase, 
        with each letter representing the first letter of a word in that phrase.
        Graphical User Interface → GUI

        An initialism is formed from the initial letters of a phrase, 
        with each letter representing the first letter of a word in that phrase.
        HyperText Markup Language → HTML

        In HTML, you can use the abbreviation element to represent both acronyms and initialisms. 
        The abbreviation element can also be used for shortened forms of words.
    -->
        <p><abbr>HTML</abbr> is the foundation of the web.</p>
    <!--
        In the browser, you'll see that nothing has really changed. 
        It still looks like normal text. 
        The abbreviation element is providing helpful context behind the scenes, 
        but users will still see the initialism as normal text.

        If you want to help users understand what this initialism means, 
        you can show its full form with the title attribute.
        The title attribute is optional, but if you decide to include it, 
        it must be a human readable description of the abbreviation, acronym, or initialism.
    -->
        <p><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the foundation of the web.</p>
    <!--
        Usually, the style of the abbreviation element will change when you add this attribute. 
        Some browsers may display a dotted underline, while others may convert the contents to small caps, 
        or even assign certain default styles.
        When users hover over the abbreviation, they will see a tooltip with the full form.
    -->


    <!-- How Do You Display Addresses in HTML?-->

    <!--
        The contact address element is used to represent contact information for a section on a web page.
        The address element is versatile and can be used for business pages, author pages, personal sites, 
        and more.
        When it comes to building out your website's contact sections, 
        you should use the semantic address element over a generic element like a div.
    -->

    <address>
        <h2>Company Name</h2>
        <p>
            1234 Elm Street<br />
            Springfield, IL 62701<br />
            United States
        </p>
        <p>Phone: <a href="tel:+15555555555">+1 (555) 555-5555</a></p>
        <p>Email: <a href="mailto:contact@company.com">contact@company.com</a></p>
    </address>
    <!--
        For the physical address, the line break element, br, 
        is used to show the division between the street name, city, and country.

        The tel:+ value inside the href attribute creates a clickable link to initiate a phone call 
        on certain devices that support that.

        For the email address, another anchor element is used with the href value set to a mailto link. 
        mailto links are used in HTML documents to allow users to open a new email 
        within their preferred email client.

        One of the downsides of using a mailto link is that users often perceive it as spam. 
        Unfortunately, a lot of spammers will use this option to send emails to users. 
        So just keep that in mind when you're using it.
