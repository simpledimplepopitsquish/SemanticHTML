    <!--How Do Block and Inline Quotes Work in HTML?-->
    <!--
        In HTML, quoted elements are used to distinguish quoted text from the surrounding content. 
        This gives the quoted text a format that is easy to identify.
        You should use the block quotation element for representing a section quoted from another source. 
        It's mainly used for extended quotations. 
        If the source of the quote has an address, you can cite it with the cite attribute.
        (the attribute doesn't really show the source to the user. It only works behind the scenes.) 
        The value of this attribute should be a valid URL.
        If you want to start and end the block quote with quotation marks, 
        you may need to write them explicitly within the text.  
    -->
    <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
        "Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? 
        To have built software systems that people rely upon?"
    </blockquote>

    <!--
        You can write the text directly within the block quotation element 
        or wrap it within one or more paragraph elements. 
        This is helpful when the text has multiple paragraphs, 
        but you want to keep them within the same block quote.    
    -->
    <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
        <p>Build your projects. Show them to your friends. Build projects for your friends.</p>
        <p>Build your network. Help the people you meet along the way. What goes around comes around. You'll get what's coming to you.</p>   
        <p>It is not too late. Life is long.</p>
        <p>You will look back on this moment years from now and be glad you made a move.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <!--
        If you want to attribute the source visually, you can add a citation element, 
        cite, outside of the block quotation element. 
        This is different from the cite attribute. 
        The citation element is an HTML element that you can use to mark up the title 
        of a referenced creative work like a book article, song, film, website, or research paper.

    <!--
        The block quotation element contains quoted text. 
        Below the element you can see a paragraph element with the name of the author, 
        followed by a citation element. 
        The citation element contains the title of the book where the quotation came from.
    -->


    <!--
        You should use block quotes like these for long quotations from other sources. 
        But sometimes you will only need to quote a few words within a larger paragraph.
        That's exactly what the inline quotation element is for. 
        It's for short inline quotations from other sources. 
        Most modern browsers will add quotation marks around the inline quote automatically 
        when you use this element.
        You can also add a cite attribute to attribute the source.
