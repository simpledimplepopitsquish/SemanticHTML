    <!--When Should You Use the Emphasis Element Over the Idiomatic Text Element?-->


    <!--
        The idiomatic text element, i, was originally used for presentational purposes to display the text in italics. 
        But now, it is frequently used for highlighting alternative voice or mood, 
        idiomatic terms from another language, technical terms, and thoughts.
    -->

    <p>There is a certain <i lang="fr">je ne sais quoi</i> in the air.</p>
    
    <!--
        The lang attribute inside the open <i> tag is used to specify the language of the content. 
        In this case, the language would be French. 
        The i element does not indicate if the text is important or not, 
        it only shows that it's somehow different from the surrounding text.
    -->
    
    <!--
        If you do need to emphasize the importance of the text, 
        you can use a similar semantic element called the emphasis element, em. 
        This is usually recommended if you need to provide more context. 
        You should use this element for parts of the text that require a special emphasis compared to surrounding text. 
        It's usually limited to only a few words, because it can alter the meaning of the sentence.
    -->

    <p>
        Never give up on <em>your</em> dreams.
        <!--
            In the browser you would see the word your is italicized to tell readers 
            that this is an important word in the sentence.
        -->
    </p>

    
    <!--When Should You Use the Strong Element Over the Bring Attention To Element?-->


    <!--
        The bring attention to element, b, is used to draw attention to text without conveying any extra importance or emphasis. 
        It is often used for keywords, product names, or other text that needs to stand out visually.
    -->
    <p>Get the new <b>SuperWidget 3000</b> today!</p>
    <!--This visual emphasis will draw readers attention to the product names.-->

    <!--
        If you need to emphasize the importance of the text, you should use the strong element 
        instead of the b element.
        Strong is a semantic HTML element that emphasizes text that is crucial, or urgent.
    -->
    <p>
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Do not operate heavy machinery after consuming alcohol.
        <!--
            In the browser you would see the word Warning is bolded to indicate 
            that this is an important part of the sentence.
        -->
    </p>

    <!--
        In summary, use the i and b elements for visual differentiation without added importance, 
        and use the em and strong elements when you need to convey emphasis or importance in your text.
        Visually both are very similar, because they are both rendered as bold by default. 
        But their meanings are quite different. 
        While the "bring attention to" element only draws attention to the text, 
        without indicating the higher level of importance, the strong element does more than that. 
        It conveys a sense of importance, or urgency. 
        This is their main difference.

    <!--What Are Description Lists, and When Should You Use Them?-->

    <!--
        Description lists are perfect for presenting terms and definitions in an organized and 
        easy-to-read format, like in a glossary, or real dictionary, 
        where you can find words with their corresponding definitions.
    -->
    <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>A markup language for creating web pages.</dd>

        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>A style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.</dd>

        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>A programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</dd>
    </dl>
    <!--
        You will need three HTML elements to define a description list:
        1. The <dl> element defines the description list itself.
        2. The <dt> element defines a term (or name) in the description list.
        3. The <dd> element provides the definition, or description, of the term.
    -->
    <!--
        Other use cases for description lists include product specifications, frequently asked questions, 
        contact information, and metadata. 
        Essentially, when you have two related pieces of information in a key-value pair format, 
        where one acts as a label, the key, and the other acts as additional related information, the value, 
        you can use a description list.
