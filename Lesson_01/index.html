    <!--Semantics are the meaning of words, or phrases, in a language. 
    In HTML, which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too.
    In fact, you can think of your HTML document like you would a text document. 
    And much like a text document, you might have headings, images, bold text, 
    and other formatting.-->

    <!--The semantic meaning of an element refers to what special information that element conveys.
    The semantic meaning of a p element, for example, is a paragraph of text-->

    <p>
      Let me tell you about my fantastic holiday in Paris.
      I saw the impressive Eiffel Tower up close!
    </p>

    <!--Most elements have semantic meaning. The div element is one of the very few that does not.-->

    <div>
      This is just a generic container with no special meaning.
    </div>

    <!--But why is this important?-->

    <!--Using semantic elements helps browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies
    understand the structure and content of your web pages better.-->

    <!--Finally, using correct semantic elements can improve your development experience. 
    Rather than having to sift through a bunch of developments to find your navigation bar, 
    you can edit the nav element directly and know what you're changing.-->

    <!--Why is it Important to Have Good Structural Hierarchy?-->

    <!--The most important aspect of creating a structural hierarchy is the proper use of heading elements. 
    Heading elements are numbered as h1, h2, h3, and so on. 
    These numbers represent the heading level for that element.

    Your h1 element is your top-level heading, and it should typically come before all of your content.

    Your h2 element is your subheading. 
    It should always come after your h1 and might come after some introductory text. 
    Unlike an h1 element, you can have multiple h2 elements on your page.
    You'll often do this to delineate different sections of content.

    Following the pattern, your h3 element should always come after an h2 element. 
    That is, you should never skip directly from h1 to h3. 
    You can, however, have multiple heading elements at the same level. -->

    <div>
        <section>
            <h1>freeCodeCamp</h1>
            <h2>Learn Front-End Development</h2>
            <h2>Learn Back-End Development</h2>
            <h3>just text</h3>
        </section>
    </div>

    <!--It may be tempting to use a specific heading element because of its styling, 
    such as h1 for large text.-->
        <article>
            <p>
                Here is some
                <h1>Large Text</h1>
            </p>
        </article>
    <!--Instead, you should choose the appropriate element for your document structure 
    and use CSS to achieve the styling you'd like.-->

    <!--Using the right hierarchy is important for accessibility. 
    Assistive technologies, like screen readers, rely on the structure of a web page 
    to determine how to parse and announce that web page to the user. 
    Using an h3 element after an h1 might cause a screen reader user to believe 
    they have accidentally skipped over important content, due to the lack of an h2 element.
    
    Proper structure is also important for SEO. 
    Search engines use automation to parse the content of your web page and determine when and where 
    it should show up in results. If your structure is malformed, 
    search engines may not be able to rank you very well in the relevant search results.
    
    Finally, depending on how incorrect your structure is, your HTML may not even be technically valid. 
    When this happens, the web browser has to effectively guess what you meant to do. 
    And what it guesses might not even be what you want at all.-->

    <!--What Is the Difference Between Presentational and Semantic HTML?-->

    <!--Presentational HTML refers to elements that are used purely for visual formatting. 
    In the early days of HTML, developers would use elements like the center, big, and font elements. 
    But in modern web development you shouldn't use these types of elements, 
    because of their limitations and negative impact on accessibility and maintainability.
    (Many presentational HTML elements are deprecated, 
    which means that they are outdated and no longer recommended. 
    There are better ways to get the same results. 
    However, it is helpful to know that they exist, so we'll take a look at some examples.)-->

    <div>
        <center>This text is centered.</center>
        <big>This text is big.</big>
        <font color="red" size="2">This text is red and small.</font>
    </div>
    <!--While this element still works, 
    you should not use it because the font size and color should always be set in CSS, 
    not in HTML.-->

    <!--Semantic HTML, on the other hand, uses elements according to their meaning and purpose.
    Search engines can easily understand your website when you use semantic HTML. 
    It's also helpful for accessibility purposes, 
    because screen readers need semantic information to describe what's on the web page.-->

    <!--Examples of semantic HTML elements include:

    The header element for defining the header of the document, or section.
    The navigation section element, nav, for sections with navigation links.
    The section element for grouping related information.
    The figure element for illustrations and diagrams.
    The footer element for defining the footer of the document, or section.
